7) make button check


/*
test out A+B macro AND E button to fly
allow disallowing of the A+B macro
*/

TODO LATWER) rework input buffer again
    > each type reads as if the button presses were in the past 3 frames
    > run it for the last 8 frames and only give out the most recent for each category
    > kara canceling

2) refactor UI
    >encapsulate different tools better
    >try the inspector-rs crate
        >its too new needs things for vectors and other container types
    

3) add bullets
    >single animation
    >hitbox
    >list properties

4) add bullet spawners to moves
    >reference list of bullets provided earlier
    >ask for values for each property asked for by the bullet

5) add 5c to yuyuko
    >spawns 4 that fly outwards
    >can be jump canceled after bullets come out
    >bullets expire when they leave the screen

each bullet has its own type
    contians methods:
        >onStart
        >onFrame
        >render
        >getHitbox
