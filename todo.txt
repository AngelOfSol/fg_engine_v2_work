TODO LATER) rework input buffer again

NOTE: create id's for attack data, so it can be edited outside of the state editor (reduce clutter), also helps for resuse, and being clear about the data 

consider removing jumpstartup flag and just looking at moveids?

there is a max zoom, there is no min zoom

5a jab (high)
2a jab (low)
5b poke (mid) (low - on rebeat)

2b poke (low) (low - on rebeat)
3b antiair <juggles> (mid)

j5a air jab (high)
j5b jump in (high) 
j6b ground slammer (high)

5c swipe that sends a spread of butterflies outward in a spiral (up to down)
2c reverse swipe (down to up) of 5b
5d spawns a butterfly that explodes into another butterfly (repeat 3 times) (high off the ground, hits standers and airdashers)
2d spawns a butterfly that explodes into another butterfly (repeat 3 times) (low to the ground, hits crouchers)

j5c spin around, like 5c but goes both sides
j5d yuyu j5b

623a/623b melee/bullet invuln DP

236c/d heat wave (5 projectiles that eat a lot of projectiles in a row forward/upforward)
j236c/d heat wave (5 projectiles that eat a lot of projectiles in a row forward/downforward)


214a/b tatsu (a tatsu goes upforwards and leaves you air acting, b tatsu goes horizontal and has good disjoint)

TODO (2/15/2020):
[x] create a main menu appstate

        [] if the windows focus is active, display that window in the render viewportm 
            [] https://docs.rs/imgui/0.3.0/imgui/struct.Ui.html#method.is_window_focused
